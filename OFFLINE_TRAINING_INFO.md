# Offline Training - Internet Connectivity Requirements

**Short Answer: NO, you do NOT need internet during training!** ✅

---

## Summary

✅ **Training works completely OFFLINE**  
✅ **All required files are already local**  
✅ **No downloads or API calls during training**  
✅ **Safe to disconnect after starting**  

---

## What's Already Local

### Data Files ✅
```
data/kg/seed_python.jsonl          6.3 MB (training data)
data/kg/train.jsonl                symlink to above
```

### Tokenizer Files ✅
```
data/tokenizer/code_bpe_large.json  311 KB (vocabulary)
data/tokenizer/code_bpe.json        562 KB (alternative)
```

### Python Packages ✅
```
torch 2.8.0                         (already installed)
numpy, pyyaml, pytest               (already installed)
transformers 4.27.1                 (installed but not used for training)
```

### Code ✅
```
All scripts and models are local Python files
No external API calls
No model downloads from HuggingFace Hub
No remote data fetching
```

## Verification Test Results

I ran a verification test that confirmed:

```
✓ PyTorch 2.8.0+cu128 loaded (local)
✓ Training data exists: data/kg/seed_python.jsonl
✓ Tokenizer exists: data/tokenizer/code_bpe_large.json
✓ No network calls in train_v2.py
✓ No from_pretrained() calls
✓ No download functions
✓ No HTTP/HTTPS requests
```

**Conclusion: Training runs 100% offline**

## What Happens During Training

### Initialization (First ~60 seconds)
1. Load config from `configs/train_cpu_optimized.yaml` (local file)
2. Load tokenizer from `data/tokenizer/code_bpe_large.json` (local file)
3. Load training data from `data/kg/seed_python.jsonl` (local file)
4. Initialize PyTorch model (all in memory, no downloads)
5. Build dataset (processes local files only)

### Training Loop (3-4 hours)
1. Read batches from in-memory dataset
2. Forward pass (pure computation)
3. Backward pass (pure computation)
4. Optimizer step (pure computation)
5. Save checkpoints to `logs/checkpoints/` (local disk)
6. Write metrics to `logs/train_v2_metrics.csv` (local disk)

**No network access needed at any point!**

## Internet IS Required For

These activities DO need internet (but NOT during training):

### Before Training
- ❌ Installing Python packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- ❌ Cloning the repository (`git clone ...`)
- ❌ Downloading initial data (if not already present)

### After Training (Optional)
- ❌ Uploading checkpoints to cloud storage
- ❌ Pushing commits to GitHub
- ❌ Downloading evaluation benchmarks (if not local)

---

## Recommended Workflow

### Option 1: Run Completely Disconnected ⭐
```bash
# 1. Verify everything is ready (while online)
ls data/kg/seed_python.jsonl
ls data/tokenizer/code_bpe_large.json
python3 -c "import torch; print('PyTorch OK')"

# 2. Disconnect from internet

# 3. Start training
bash tmp_rovodev_start_10k_training.sh

# 4. Let it run for 3-4 hours (no internet needed)

# 5. Reconnect when done (optional, for git/sharing)
```

### Option 2: Leave Connected (Also Fine)
```bash
# Start training while connected
bash tmp_rovodev_start_10k_training.sh

# Can disconnect at any time without affecting training
# Can reconnect at any time without affecting training
```

## Benefits of Offline Training

✅ **No network issues** - Can't fail due to connection problems  
✅ **Reproducible** - No external dependencies that might change  
✅ **Faster startup** - No time wasted on downloads  
✅ **Privacy** - No data sent to external servers  
✅ **Portable** - Can run on airgapped machines

## Common Concerns Addressed

### Q: What if my internet drops during training?
**A:** No problem at all! Training continues unaffected.

### Q: Does PyTorch need internet for GPU operations?
**A:** No. PyTorch is fully local once installed. (You're using CPU anyway.)

### Q: Does the model download pretrained weights?
**A:** No. This is training from scratch, not fine-tuning.

### Q: Will checkpoints be saved if I'm offline?
**A:** Yes! Checkpoints save to local disk (`logs/checkpoints/`).

### Q: Can I monitor training while offline?
**A:** Yes! All logs are written to local files:
```bash
# Watch training progress (works offline)
tail -f logs/train_10k_*.log

# Check metrics (works offline)
tail -f logs/train_v2_metrics.csv
```

---

## Testing Offline Mode (Optional)

If you want to be 100% sure, test it:

```bash
# 1. Enable airplane mode or disconnect ethernet

# 2. Run a quick test
python3 scripts/train_v2.py \
  --config configs/train_cpu_optimized.yaml \
  --steps 10 \
  --seed 42

# 3. Should complete successfully without internet
```

## Summary

**You can safely:**
- Start training while connected ✅
- Disconnect during training ✅
- Run training completely offline ✅
- Close your laptop (if it doesn't suspend) ✅
- Let it run overnight without worrying ✅

**Internet is NOT needed for:**
- Loading data ✅
- Loading tokenizer ✅
- Model initialization ✅
- Training loop ✅
- Saving checkpoints ✅
- Writing logs ✅

**Bottom line: Start the training and don't worry about internet connectivity!**
