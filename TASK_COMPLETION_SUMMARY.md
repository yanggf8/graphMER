## Recommended Next Actions

Based on your original priorities, here's the suggested order:

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Comprehensive Evaluation** ⭐ RECOMMENDED NEXT
   ```bash
   python scripts/eval.py --config configs/modelscope_config.yaml
   ```
   - Validate model quality beyond training metrics
   - Measure MRR, Hits@k, per-relation accuracy
   - Estimated time: 1-2 minutes

2. **Scale to Full Dataset**
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py --config configs/modelscope_config.yaml --steps 1000 --limit 5000 --chunk_size 50
   ```
   - Use more of the 29,174 available triples
   - Expected: Better generalization, reduced variance
