# GraphMER-SE Handover

Status date: <fill-in>
Owner: <your-name>

## 1) Context
Personal project to adapt GraphMER (neurosymbolic encoder) to software engineering. We target an ~80M encoder-only model, CPU-first training with optional TPU, and a spec-driven repo.

## 2) Current State (End-to-End, Validated)
- Ontology and specs
  - docs/specs/objective.md, project_plan.md, ontology_spec.yaml (v0.1.0 aligned), problem_spec.md, data_spec.yaml, eval_spec.yaml, model_card.md.
  - Key relations supported and validated: defines/defined_in, contains, declares, imports, calls, invokes, instantiates, returns, raises, catches, annotated_with, tests, depends_on, produces.
- KG pipeline
  - src/parsing/python_parser.py extracts ontology-aligned triples from Python.
  - src/kg/builder.py builds JSONL triples + entities from sample code.
  - src/ontology/kg_validator.py validates domain/range and acyclicity.
  - Validation: domain_range_ratio = 1.00 on samples; inherits_acyclic = True.
- Encoding and training (CPU)
  - Leafy Chain sequence packer (stub) and KG-backed dataset builder.
  - Dual objectives: MLM + MNM (smoke run working, losses decreasing).
  - HGAT-lite: relation embeddings + relation-aware attention bias (TinyRelSelfAttention) behind flag.
  - Logging: CSV at logs/train_metrics.csv with step, loss, loss_mlm, loss_mnm, val_acc_mlm, val_acc_mnm.
- CI
  - Tests + 5-step smoke run (Linux): ontology/spec/configs validation and training sanity pass.

## 3) How to Run Locally
- Build and validate the seed KG
```
python scripts/build_kg.py
```
- CPU smoke training (with relation attention bias)
```
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train_cpu.yaml --steps 50
cat logs/train_metrics.csv
```
- Toggle relation attention bias (embedding-only HGAT)
  - Edit configs/train_cpu.yaml: `model.use_rel_attention_bias: false`

Goal: Quantify the impact of attention-bias HGAT vs embedding-only HGAT.

Hypotheses
- H1: Attention bias improves MNM convergence (lower loss_mnm at same step).
- H2: Attention bias does not hurt MLM (loss_mlm similar or slightly better).
- H3: With attention bias, validation accuracy for MNM rises earlier on small splits.

Experimental Design
- Conditions:
  - A: Embedding-only HGAT (use_rel_attention_bias=false)
  - B: Attention-bias HGAT (use_rel_attention_bias=true)
- Controls:
  - Same seed, same dataset (rebuild KG once), same steps (e.g., 500 for a clearer signal), same optimizer/lr.
- Metrics to compare:
  - Curves: loss, loss_mlm, loss_mnm per step; val_acc_mlm, val_acc_mnm.
  - Summaries at fixed steps (e.g., step=100, 200, 500) and final.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - MNM: ≥ 5–10% relative improvement in final loss or val_acc.
  - MLM: no significant regression (>5% worse) compared to embedding-only.

Suggested Procedure
1) Build KG once
```
python scripts/build_kg.py
```
2) Run A (embedding-only)
```
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train_cpu.yaml --steps 200
# Before run, set model.use_rel_attention_bias: false in configs/train_cpu.yaml
cp logs/train_metrics.csv logs/train_metrics_A.csv
```
3) Run B (attention-bias)
```
# Set model.use_rel_attention_bias: true in configs/train_cpu.yaml
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train_cpu.yaml --steps 200
cp logs/train_metrics.csv logs/train_metrics_B.csv
```
4) Compare
- Plot or inspect CSVs; compute relative differences at final step and at checkpoints (100/150/200).
- Focus on loss_mnm and val_acc_mnm.

Notes and Tips
- To stabilize validation:
  - Increase dataset size in scripts/train.py by changing `limit` (e.g., 128) and `chunk_size` (e.g., 3–4) when calling `build_dataset_from_kg`.
  - Optionally increase steps to 500 for smoother curves.
- Keep CPU run overnight if needed; it’s compute-light but slower wall-clock.

## 5) Risks / Watchouts
- Small dataset may yield noisy val_acc; rely on multi-point comparisons (not single step).
- Parser coverage still basic; different relation mixes can affect MNM dynamics.
- Ensure the ontology remains synchronized if you extend relations.

## 6) Short Roadmap (post-ablation)
- If MNM improves with attention bias:
  - Scale dataset moderately; add Java stub or more Python projects.
  - Add attention-bias ablation to CI as a short run (optional).
- If gains are unclear:
  - Add head-specific biases or learnable per-head bias scalars.
  - Add relation-position-aware bias (stronger bias near [REL] and relation token).
- General enhancements:
  - Better tokenizer for identifiers; validation set split by file to reduce leakage.
  - Metrics logging to JSON and simple plotting notebook.

## 7) Artifacts Checklist
- Configs: configs/train_cpu.yaml (flag use_rel_attention_bias).
- Encoder/Training: src/models/encoder.py, scripts/train.py, src/training/*.
- KG: scripts/build_kg.py, src/kg/builder.py, data/... outputs.
- Ontology: docs/specs/ontology_spec.yaml (+ validator in src/ontology/).
- CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml.

## 8) Handover Summary
- Pipeline is working end-to-end on CPU with relation-aware attention bias.
- Ontology-KG alignment validated at 100% on samples.
- Next: run the ablation (A vs B) to quantify the value of attention bias for MNM.

Ablation helpers available:
- scripts/run_ablation.py: automates A/B runs by overriding the relation bias flag via --rel_bias and saves logs to logs/train_metrics_A.csv and logs/train_metrics_B.csv.
  Usage:
  
      python scripts/run_ablation.py --config configs/train_cpu.yaml --steps 200
  
- scripts/summarize_logs.py: summarizes A/B CSVs at checkpoints and final step.
  Usage:
  
      python scripts/summarize_logs.py --steps 100 150 200
