# GraphMER-SE Model Placeholder
# This would contain the actual GGUF conversion of your PyTorch model
# 
# To implement full conversion:
# 1. Export model to ONNX format
# 2. Use llama.cpp conversion tools
# 3. Quantize for efficient serving
#
# Model specs:
# - Parameters: 85M
# - Architecture: Transformer + Graph Positional Encoding
# - Training: 10,000 steps on RTX 3070
# - Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
# - Knowledge Graph: 28,961 triples
